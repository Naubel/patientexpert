## Patient Expert

Patient Expert is a desktop application written in Java, which uses the Apache Derby Client Driver and JavaDB as a database. 
The main purpose behind this project was to create an application that would allow physicians around the world to manage patients, consultations, 
specialists, tasks and notes. Patient Expert uses an encrypted database connection and also has a password-protected interface, for which administrators
can be added or removed.
